assignment relates to function, dictionary, loop, list, files.

We are asked to write a program that read the master input list file, retrieves the names of the data files and from
each one of them reads every line, extract name and distance. Once the program has all the data in memory, it has to
compute the following quantities and informations:
    • number of files read in input
    • total number of lines read
    • total distance run (aka the sum of all the distances loaded from provided files)
    • total distance run for each individual participant
    • individual maximum distance run and by which participant
    • individual minimum distance run and by which participant
    • report if there are any participants that appears more than once, how many times and their names
    • total number of participants
The program should provide an terminal output similar to the following:
    Number of Input files read    : xx
    Total number of lines read    : xx
    total distance run            : participant name
    max distance run by participant : xxxx.xxxxx
    min distance run              : xxxx.xxxxx
    by participant                : participant name
    Total number of participants : xx
    Number of participants
    with multiple records : xx

The program should also create an output file reporting name of the participant, how many times their name appears in
the input files and the total distance run. Each row should be as follows:
    Max,3,124.23
    Barbara,2,65.00
    Luka,1,12.87
    ...



IMax = max(zip(record.values(),record.keys()))
